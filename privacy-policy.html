    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 2025-08-12</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to MY ADS MANAGE, a personal tool I developed for myself to call and retrieve ad data from my own Meta ad accounts via the Meta Marketing API. This app is not intended for use by others and does not collect data from third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The app collects and processes the following information solely for my personal use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ad data reports from my own authorized Meta ad accounts (e.g., campaign performance metrics).</li>
        <li>Any necessary authentication tokens or device information to facilitate API calls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This app does not collect, store, or process any personal data from other users. All data is handled temporarily during API requests and is not retained.</p>
    
    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>The information is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate personal ad data reports for my own analysis.</li>
        <li>Comply with Meta's API terms and any applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>No data is shared with third parties, as this is a personal tool. Data remains on my local device or is processed via Meta's secure APIs.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>I take reasonable measures to secure the app, including using Meta's authenticated APIs. However, as with any online tool, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since this app is for personal use only, there are no third-party users. If you are me (the developer), I can access, update, or delete any processed data manually. For inquiries, contact: [Your Email, e.g., privacy@myapp.com].</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please email: [Your Email].</p>
    
    <p>This policy may be updated as needed. Please check back periodically.</p>
